/**
 * \brief Fully connected layer implementation
 *
 * The function implements the fully connected layer, and it's basically a thin wrapper around the 
 * Matrix_Vector_Activate_Batch function to perform the stream width conversion.
 * 
 * \tparam MatrixW    Width of the input matrix
 * \tparam MatrixH    Heigth of the input matrix
 * \tparam SIMD       Number of input columns computed in parallel
 * \tparam PE         Number of output rows computed in parallel
 * \tparam TSrcI      DataType of the input activation (as used in the MAC)
 * \tparam TDstI      DataType of the output activation (as generated by the activation)
 * \tparam TWeightI   DataType of the weights (as used in the MAC)
 * \tparam InStreamW  Width of the input stream
 * \tparam OutStreamW Width of the output stream
 * \tparam TW         DataType of the weights matrix - safely deducible from the paramaters
 * \tparam TA         DataType of the activation class (e.g. thresholds) - safely deducible from the paramaters
 * \tparam R          Datatype for the resource used for FPGA implementation of the MAC  - safely deducible from the paramaters
 *
 * \param in          Input stream
 * \param out         Output stream
 * \param weights     Weights matrix (currently supports BinaryWeights or FixedPointWeights)
 * \param activation  Activation class
 * \param reps        Number of time the function has to be repeatedly executed (e.g. number of images)
 * \param r           Resource type for the hardware implementation of the MAC block
