# S2N2

This repository contains code for experiments described in [S2N2: A Streaming Accelerator for Streaming Spiking Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3431920.3439283)

## HLS

S2N2 is built upon the [FINN-HLS library](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn-hlslib) and currently supports Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model.

## Applications

Our three applications, rf1, rf2, and cv, are trained with variants of [dcll library](https://github.com/nmi-lab/dcll).
